Testing:
135 mountains for 1x mountains and 1 x 1 board
112 mountains for 1x mountains and 0.75 x 0.75 board
108 mountains for 1x mountains and 0.5 x 0.5 board
103 mountains for 1x mountains and 0 x 0 board
Result:
num_mountains is approximately 100 + (mountain_density) * 40

Testing:
20 cities for 1x cities and 0 x 0 board
20 cities for 1x cities and 0.25 x 0.25 board
all others were about 20 as well
Result:
num_cities is approximately (10 * city_density) x the number of players
